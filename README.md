# WebPortfolio
In this project, you will create a portfolio website to display your work experience and projects by coding along with the tutorial. You will create a new GitHub repo and deploy your app live using Netlify or github pages. Your task is to follow the video tutorial and customize the website to suit your own needs. You are provided starter files with assets to complete the tutorial, but you should replace portraits with your own beautiful faces and the example Resume with your own. 

Be creative and change any of the fonts, colors, styles, etc. Extra creativity and effort could result in bonus points!

 

By the end of this project, you will:

Create a multipart portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JS.
Build a website that is responsive on both desktop and mobile
Deploy a live website using Netlify.
Use GitHub for source control.
